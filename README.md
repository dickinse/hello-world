Option 1 - GitHub "Hello World" Exercise

## Editing the ReadMe file

Editing the readme file for this github project. Using some __markdown__ format to make things a little bit spicier.

As Grace Hopper said:

Lists are important to know how to do
1. Ordered instructions
2. Are easier to follow
3. Than unordered ones
	* This is a personal opinion
	* It really shouldn't change anything at all

Thanks, [GitHub](http://github.com) markdown!
